# notes
* mips sometimes has opcode encoded on LHS, sometimes RHS, see xor and xori
* mips has FPU fmt mnemonics like ".s", ".d", ".w" ".l" and ".ps", see A.3 Floating Point Unit Instruction Format Encodings
* mips opcode is sometimes way distant from opcode.X, for example srl is 00000002 but srl.d is 796FF04D
* this is main reason why I include fmt in the opcode
